# Pushbutton-Controlled State Machine | PIC32MZ2048EFH144

This project implements a pushbutton-driven finite state machine (FSM) on the PIC32MZ2048EFH144 microcontroller using MPLAB X v4.15 and Harmony v2. An LED visually indicates each state, and the system transitions between states based on button inputs with precise software-based debouncing.

## 🚀 Features

- Finite State Machine with three active states and one initial state
- Two pushbuttons for forward and reverse state transitions
- LED indicators for each state (LED1, LED2, LED3)
- Software-based debouncing using SYS_TMR_TickCountGet() for accurate edge detection
- Non-blocking logic for real-time responsiveness
